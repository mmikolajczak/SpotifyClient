# SpotifyClient

As name indicates it is a Spotify client, that uses its REST api.
Functionalities are rather basic, as for requirements:
- the Api is publically available, not even a key or some validation
key is required.
- except requests (that can be installed using pip) the modules
used comes with default python 3 instalation.

Created as a solution to task during STXNext workshops.
